Print all parts with your favourite slicer, supports should be used for the base plate.

Note: Do _NOT_ use the x carriage included here, it is *only* for reference during design and is from
the Mendel90 Sturdy variant, the carriage generated for your particular machine should be used provided the hole width is
the same (check by importing your own x carriage).

Insert 2 M4 countersunk bolts up from the bottom of the base (the bottom is the part where the e3d mounts to) and bolt the 90 degree
supports to the base plate, use an m4 washer and nyloc nut.

Screw the motor to the mount plate with the short side (side with the holes closest to the edge) facing the back of the x carriage using the M3 x 8 screws and M3 washers.

Loosely fit your filament drive wheel to the motor shaft, insert the filament guide into the base (**don't** glue it in), sit the motor + mount plate on the base and adjust the position
of the filament drive wheel to line up with the filament guide.

Assemble the E3D as per the E3D instructions (note: This mount was designed for the size of a genuine E3D v6), putting in the little black PTFE liner clip but NOT the liner itself just yet,
and leave the fan shroud off for now.

Push the E3D into the base plate clip

Insert a length of PTFE liner into the hotend, long enough to reach the top of the filament guide, sit the filament guide in the base and trim the PTFE tube with a sharp knife to match the 
profile of the guide. (note: future removal of the liner is still possible as long as you don't ever glue in the filament guide.)

Put the base plate + e3d assembly onto your x carriage and secure with M4 x 15 countersunk bolts and nylock nuts. One of them may interfere with the E3D fan depending on the shroud orientation
, thickness of the base plate, and length of available screws, trimming of one bolt may be necessary.

Use 1x M4 x 15 bolt to secure the back of the mount plate to the 90 degree upright, secure with M4 washer and nyloc nut

Secure the filament inlet / idler mount with 2x M4 x 45 bolts, washers, and nyloc nuts.

Insert an M4 rod into the bearing, an M4 washer either side and insert into the idler bearing holder.

Attach idler bearing holder using M4 x 70 bolts, a washer either side of the spring and M4 nyloc nuts.
(I just use 2x M4 x 70 bolts here, 4 is a bit overkill but that was the original design so it's up to you.)
